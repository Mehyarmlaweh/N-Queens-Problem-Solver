# N-Queens Problem Solver

The N-Queens puzzle, a classic chessboard problem, tasks us with placing N queens on an NxN grid so that no two queens threaten each other. Despite its apparent simplicity, the puzzle poses significant challenges due to its vast number of potential configurations.

## Overview

This project tackles the N-Queens problem utilizing algorithmic techniques and Constraint Satisfaction Programming (CSP) as two main strategies. CSP effectively reduces the search space by dividing the problem into manageable parts through the specification of variables, domains, and constraints. Algorithms such as Depth-First Search and Backtracking systematically explore various combinations to identify a solution.

## Objectives

Our objective is to address the complexity of the N-Queens problem by merging various methods and investigating the trade-off between computer capacity and human intuition. We aim to not only find solutions to the puzzle but also gain insights into more general issues related to optimization and problem-solving in the context of combinatorial puzzles.
